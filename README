A plugin to make VIM's autocomplete more like Textmate's: it searches for matching words both before and after the cursor, and orders the matches by distance from the cursor (closest first).

By default it is bound to <D-j>. Pressing <D-j> when the popup window is open will move down the list.
Pressing 'escape' in the popup will close the popup
Pressing 'return' in the popup will insert the currently selected word and close the popup

Install with pathogen.
